### Development Setup

---

1. Fork this repo
2. Clone the repo that you just forked to your Github account<br>
   ```
   git clone YOU_FORKED_REPO
   cd social-media-pic
   ```
3. Install dependencies<br>
   ```
   npm i && cd client && npm i
   ```
4. Create a `dev.js` file into `config` folder
5. Set up the _config/dev.js_ file<br>
   [MongoDB Connection String](https://docs.mongodb.com/guides/server/drivers/)<br>
   [Create SendGrid API key](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/api-keys/#creating-an-api-key) (we select 'Full Access' here for now)<br>
   ```js
   module.exports = {
     MONGO_URI: 'YOUR_MongoDB_Connection_String',
     JWT_SECRET: 'YOUR_JWT_SECRET',
     SEND_GRID_API: 'YOUR_SEND_GRID_API',
     EMAIL_LINK: 'http://localhost:3000',
     EMAIL_FROM: 'YOUR_EMAIL (requested by SendGrid)',
   };
   ```
   ps. The email put in 'EMAIL_FROM' is requested to be verified by SendGrid before they help delivering an email to the user.<br>
   &emsp;So if you're not using the Forget & Reset Password functionality(which will send an email), you could just leave it for now.<p>
6. Run the project
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   <p>

#### Optional

Create your [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/upload_presets)

1. Add Cloudinary `IMG_UPLOAD API` to _assets/api-call.js_
2. Add [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/users/login) `upload_preset` & `cloud_name` to the _components/create-post.component.jsx_<br>
   and _components/edit-profile.component.jsx_ file

   ```js
   formData.append('upload_preset', 'YOUR_UPLOAD_PRESETS_NAME');
   formData.append('cloud_name', 'YOUR_CLOUD_NAME');
   formData.append('folder', 'YOUR_FOLDER_NAME');
   ```
